\acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the help of my advisers, Carmen Morgado and Ruben Dias, who helped me overcome the obstacles, and pushed me to go further and to do more than I was expecting to.

To the work colleagues at Knowledgebiz, that made the days easier and the lunch breaks fun, and especially to Pedro, who accompanied me since my internship and gave very useful tips, and had always a clever suggestion to every problem I had.

To all my friends, that without knowing, helped to clear the mind of all the problems.
Special thanks to Maria and Gonçalo, who were always up for an afternoon snack and to talk about anything. 

Finally, I am very grateful to my parents and sister, who were always there at the end of the day to provide support and guidance. Without them none of this would have been possible.
