Team Sports like basketball, football and baseball rely on data insights to improve player and team performance, practice scheduling and injury recovery. Recent improvements in data mining and machine learning techniques have encouraged the research of better ways to collect player data.

There are different approaches currently available, using video tracking systems or wearable sensors. The latter systems can be very precise in tracking position outdoors using GPS or indoors using Ultra-Wideband or RFID positioning, they fall short in the analysis of game related metrics, like accelerations and jumps or passes and shoots in the case of Basketball.

This work proposes a solution that can track both position and metrics of players and teams in real-time using inertial sensors, providing the users (e.g.\ players, coaches) an application with insightful information in order to improve the performance of the individual player and the whole team.
