\chapter{Elaboration Proposal}
\label{cha:elaboration_proposal}
Previous chapters describe the issues that this thesis will address, the theories that support the proposed solution and the other approaches that currently exist and try to solve the same issues.

This thesis is divided into four segments: the study of the state of the art, the development and implementation of the prototype, the testing and validation and the documentation of the results. The schedule is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schedule}. These segments are divided in the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{enum:1} Analysis of the state of the art
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{enum:1a} State of the art of tracking algorithms using inertial sensors
        \item \label{enum:1b} State of the art of basketball individual metrics
        \item \label{enum:1c} State of the art of sensor communication protocols
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \label{enum:2} Implementation
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{enum:2a} Enable data extraction from multiple sensors
        \item \label{enum:2b} Implementing and improving a pedestrian tracking algorithm
        \item \label{enum:2c} Development of basketball metrics identification algorithms
        \item \label{enum:2d} Testing different configurations of placement of sensors in body
        \item \label{enum:2e} Integrating both systems in a real-time mobile application
        \item \label{enum:2f} Building Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sensor networks and performance testing
        \item \label{enum:2g} Further development of mobile application
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \label{enum:3} Tests and Validation
    \item \label{enum:4} Final results publication
\end{enumerate}

\section{Elaboration Phases}
\label{sec:elaboration_phases}
Step~\ref{enum:1} was completed in the starting of this dissertation preparation phase. The study of the state of the art is presented in Chapter~\ref{cha:state_art}.

Step~\ref{enum:2a} and~\ref{enum:2b}, as described in Section~\ref{sec:developments}, was almost fully developed during the preparation phase. Step~\ref{enum:2a} enabled the collection of data from multiple sensors placed on an individual. In the elaboration phase a better way to attach the sensor to the foot will have to be found.

In Step~\ref{enum:2c} there will be developed algorithms to identify basketball game metrics, and along with this development a study of the best positioning of the sensors will be made. Afterwards, in Step~\ref{enum:2e}, the tracking system and the metrics identification system will be merged, in a real-time mobile application. Step~\ref{enum:2f} will focuses on scaling these systems in order to collect data from multiple data at the same time, experimenting sensor networks using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sensors, and comparing their performance. Step~\ref{enum:2} will culminate in the further development of the mobile application, where the data collected and analysed from the multiple sensors will be displayed in order to give insights about the players and the team performance.

Step~\ref{enum:3} will consist in testing and validating the final prototype, and Step~\ref{enum:4} will consist in the documentation and publication of the results of this dissertation.
