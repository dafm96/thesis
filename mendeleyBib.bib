abstract = {Objective: Sport research often requires human motion capture of an athlete. It can, however, be labour-intensive and difficult to select the right system, while manufacturers report on specifications which are determined in set-ups that largely differ from sport research in terms of volume, environment and motion. The aim of this review is to assist researchers in the selection of a suitable motion capture system for their experimental set-up for sport applications. An open online platform is initiated, to support (sport)researchers in the selection of a system and to enable them to contribute and update the overview. Design: systematic review; Method: Electronic searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were performed, and the reference lists of the screened articles were scrutinised to determine human motion capture systems used in academically published studies on sport analysis. Results: An overview of 17 human motion capture systems is provided, reporting the general specifications given by the manufacturer (weight and size of the sensors, maximum capture volume, environmental feasibilities), and calibration specifications as determined in peer-reviewed studies. The accuracy of each system is plotted against the measurement range. Conclusion: The overview and chart can assist researchers in the selection of a suitable measurement system. To increase the robustness of the database and to keep up with technological developments, we encourage researchers to perform an accuracy test prior to their experiment and to add to the chart and the system overview (online, open access).},

abstract = {Human activities are inherently translation invariant and hierarchical. Human activity recognition (HAR), a field that has garnered a lot of attention in recent years due to its high demand in various application domains, makes use of time-series sensor data to infer activities. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (convnet) is proposed to perform efficient and effective HAR using smartphone sensors by exploiting the inherent characteristics of activities and 1D time-series signals, at the same time providing a way to automatically and data-adaptively extract robust features from raw data. Experiments show that convnets indeed derive relevant and more complex features with every additional layer, although difference of feature complexity level decreases with every additional layer. A wider time span of temporal local correlation can be exploited (1 × 9-1 × 14) and a low pooling size (1 × 2-1 × 3) is shown to be beneficial. Convnets also achieved an almost perfect classification on moving activities, especially very similar ones which were previously perceived to be very difficult to classify. Lastly, convnets outperform other state-of-the-art data mining techniques in HAR for the benchmark dataset collected from 30 volunteer subjects, achieving an overall performance of 94.79{\%} on the test set with raw sensor data, and 95.75{\%} with additional information of temporal fast Fourier transform of the HAR data set.},

abstract = {The analysis and evaluation of human movement is a growing research area within the field of sports monitoring. This analysis can help support the enhancement of an athlete's performance, the prediction of injuries or the optimization of training programs. Although camera-based techniques are often used to evaluate human movements, not all movements of interest can be analyzed or distinguished effectively with computer vision only. Wearable inertial systems are a promising technology to address this limitation. This paper presents a new wearable sensing system to record human movements for sports monitoring. A new paradigm is presented with the purpose of monitoring basketball players with multiple inertial measurement units. A data collection plan has been designed and implemented, and experimental results show the potential of the system in basketball activity recognition.},

Various classifiers from the Classification Learner App in MATLAB is used to recognize the common sport activity. In data collection, 10 subjects are asked to perform several common sport activities which is stationary, walking, jogging, sprinting, and jumping. The data is collected by using Physilog{\textregistered} 4 Silver which is an inertial sensor from Gait Up that is attached to the chest of the subject using strap. 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data from inertial sensor is observed and processed in this study. To recognize the common sport activity from the data, time-domain features such as mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum value is extracted from the signal produced by inertial sensor. After that, the data is trained using the selected features and 10-fold cross validation is applied to set the training and testing data. The confusion matrix and accuracy result from each classifier is observed. In conclusion, Support Vector Machine with Cubic SVM is selected as the best model in recognizing common sport activity as it produced the highest accuracy, 91.2{\%} in the confusion matrix. This classifier performance outperforms other classifiers in detecting five types of common sport activity from the data collected.},

The combined information from this set of sensors allows determining the trajectory and orientation of the robot at any moment to complement the information from its navigation system. Initially, it was necessary to build controlled test environments that allow observing and getting to know the trajectory and the dimensions thereof for capturing the raw data of the mobile robotic platform. Then, the data obtained form the sensor was processed off-line applying a Kalman filter with the aim to remove Gaussian noise; to estimating the trajectory and the absolute orientation of the mobile robotic platform the proposed algorithm was implemented. This implementation used the hardware elements are inexpensive, thus allowing the necessary testing, the data analysis and the interpretation of the outcome to be replicable and to be used as an educational tool within courses of undergraduate and master level. The elements of hardware used in this implementation are cheap, allowing its reproduction for the analysis and interpretation of data and can be used as an educational tool in courses of undergraduate and master level.},

abstract = {Measurement of human posture and movement is an important area of research in the bioengineering and rehabilitation fields. Various attempts have been initiated for different clinical application goals, such as diagnosis of pathological posture and movements, assessment of pre- and post-treatment efficacy and comparison of different treatment protocols. Image-based methods for measurements of human posture and movements have been developed, such as the photogrammetry, optoelectric technique and video analysis. However, it is found that these methods are complicated to set up, time-consuming to operate and could only be applied in laboratory environments. Electronic sensors and systems with advanced technology, namely accelerometer, gyroscope, flexible angular sensor, electromagnetic tracking system and sensing fabrics, have been developed and applied to solve the relevant application problems of the image-based methods. Nonetheless, other problems for using these electronic sensors emerged, including the environment influence and signal extraction difficulties. Further development of these electronic sensors and measurement methods could enhance their clinical applications in institutional as well as community levels. This article reviews the possible applications of these electronic sensors and systems, and precautions of their applications in analysis of human posture and movement. Such information would help researchers and clinicians in selecting and developing the most appropriate measurement techniques of using the electronic sensors for clinical applications of human posture and movement analysis.},

abstract = {Indoor pedestrian tracking extends location-based services to indoor environments where GPS signal is rarely detected. Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios.

This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The present study aims to identify the accuracy of the NBN23{\textregistered} system, an indoor tracking system based on radio-frequency and standard Bluetooth Low Energy channels. Twelve capture tags were attached to a custom cart with fixed distances of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.8 m. The cart was pushed along a predetermined course following the lines of a standard dimensions Basketball court. The course was performed at low speed ({\textless}10.0 km/h), medium speed ({\textgreater}10.0 km/h and {\textless}20.0 km/h) and high speed ({\textgreater}20.0 km/h). Root mean square error (RMSE) and percentage of variance accounted for ({\%}VAF) were used as accuracy measures. The obtained data showed acceptable accuracy results for both RMSE and {\%}VAF, despite the expected degree of error in position measurement at higher speeds. The RMSE for all the distances and velocities presented an average absolute error of 0.30 ± 0.13 cm with 90.61 ± 8.34 of {\%}VAF, in line with most available systems, and considered acceptable for indoor sports. The processing of data with filter correction seemed to reduce the noise and promote a lower relative error, increasing the {\%}VAF for each measured distance. Research using positional-derived variables in Basketball is still very scarce; thus, this independent test of the NBN23{\textregistered} tracking system provides accuracy details and opens up opportunities to develop new performance indicators that help to optimize training adaptations and performance.},

For instance, activity recognition systems can be adopted in a smart home health care system to improve their rehabilitation processes of patients. There are various ways of using different sensors for human activity recognition in a smartly controlled environment. Among which, physical human activity recognition through wearable sensors provides valuable information about an individual's degree of functional ability and lifestyle. In this paper, we present a smartphone inertial sensors-based approach for human activity recognition. Efficient features are first extracted from raw data. The features include mean, median, autoregressive coefficients, etc. The features are further processed by a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to make them more robust. Finally, the features are trained with a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for successful activity recognition. The proposed approach was compared with traditional expression recognition approaches such as typical multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where it outperformed them.},

The classification techniques implemented and compared in this study are: Bayesian decision making (BDM), the least-squares method (LSM), the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), dynamic time warping (DTW), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Daily and sports activities are classified using five sensor units worn by eight subjects on the chest, the arms, and the legs. Each sensor unit comprises a triaxial gyroscope, a triaxial accelerometer, and a triaxial magnetometer. Principal component analysis (PCA) and sequential forward feature selection (SFFS) methods are employed for feature reduction. For a small number of features, SFFS demonstrates better performance and should be preferable especially in real-time applications. The classifiers are validated using different cross-validation techniques. Among the different classifiers we have considered, BDM results in the highest correct classification rate with relatively small computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Additionally, the IMU sensor is designed to recognize nine kinds of basic basketball movements, such as stand, walk, run, jump, in-situ dribble, dribble while walking, dribble while running, set shot, and jump shot. Experimentally, the IMU sensor is worn on the player's right wrist. Meanwhile, the player's movements are captured by the sports camera (GoPro Hero 6) for reference. Further, five features are extracted from y-axis acceleration (YAA) data and z-axis angular velocity (ZAAV) data for the analysis of basketball movements. Finally, a 98.9{\%} accuracy rate of recognizing each basic basketball movement of one player is achieved by using a neural network algorithm.},

In this paper, we present an approach that allows to monitor players' actions during a game, such as dribbling, shooting, blocking, or passing, with wrist-worn inertial sensors. In a feasibility study, inertial data from a sensor worn on the wrist were recorded during training and game sessions from three players.We illustrate that common features and classifiers are able to recognize short actions, with overall accuracy performances around 83.6{\%} (k-Nearest-Neighbor) and 87.5{\%} (Random Forest).

abstract = {Human activity recognition has gained importance in recent years due to its applications in various fields such as health, security and surveillance, entertainment, and intelligent environments. A significant amount of work has been done on human activity recognition and researchers have leveraged different approaches, such as wearable, object-tagged, and device-free, to recognize human activities. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the work conducted over the period 2010-2018 in various areas of human activity recognition with main focus on device-free solutions. The device-free approach is becoming very popular due to the fact that the subject is not required to carry anything, instead, the environment is tagged with devices to capture the required information. We propose a new taxonomy for categorizing the research work conducted in the field of activity recognition and divide the existing literature into three sub-areas: action-based, motion-based, and interaction-based. We further divide these areas into ten different sub-topics and present the latest research work in these sub-topics. Unlike previous surveys which focus only on one type of activities, to the best of our knowledge, we cover all the sub-areas in activity recognition and provide a comparison of the latest research work in these sub-areas. Specifically, we discuss the key attributes and design approaches for the work presented. Then we provide extensive analysis based on 10 important metrics, to give the reader, a complete overview of the state-of-the-art techniques and trends in different sub-areas of human activity recognition. In the end, we discuss open research issues and provide future research directions in the field of human activity recognition.},

This measurement method has a high impact in human performance assessment and human-robot interaction. IMU motion tracking systems are indeed self-contained and wearable, allowing for long-lasting tracking of the user motion in situated environments. After a survey on IMU-based human tracking, five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion.
