abstract = {The traditional basketball training is unable to be quantified and shared with others for it heavily relies on the coach's experience. In this paper, we develop an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to collect movement data of the basketball player and identify his postures, which helps improve the coach's guidance and the athletes' skills in a quality manner. Additionally, the IMU sensor is designed to recognize nine kinds of basic basketball movements, such as stand, walk, run, jump, in-situ dribble, dribble while walking, dribble while running, set shot, and jump shot. Experimentally, the IMU sensor is worn on the player's right wrist. Meanwhile, the player's movements are captured by the sports camera (GoPro Hero 6) for reference. Further, five features are extracted from y-axis acceleration (YAA) data and z-axis angular velocity (ZAAV) data for the analysis of basketball movements. Finally, a 98.9{\%} accuracy rate of recognizing each basic basketball movement of one player is achieved by using a neural network algorithm.},

abstract = {Game play in the sport of basketball tends to combine highly dynamic phases in which the teams strategically move across the field, with specific actions made by individual players. Analysis of basketball games usually focuses on the locations of players at particular points in the game, whereas the capture of what actions the players were performing remains underrepresented. In this paper, we present an approach that allows to monitor players' actions during a game, such as dribbling, shooting, blocking, or passing, with wrist-worn inertial sensors. In a feasibility study, inertial data from a sensor worn on the wrist were recorded during training and game sessions from three players.We illustrate that common features and classifiers are able to recognize short actions, with overall accuracy performances around 83.6{\%} (k-Nearest-Neighbor) and 87.5{\%} (Random Forest). Some actions, such as jump shots, performed well (± 95{\%} accuracy), whereas some types of dribbling achieving low (± 44{\%}) recall.},

abstract = {The present study aims to identify the accuracy of the NBN23{\textregistered} system, an indoor tracking system based on radio-frequency and standard Bluetooth Low Energy channels. Twelve capture tags were attached to a custom cart with fixed distances of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.8 m. The cart was pushed along a predetermined course following the lines of a standard dimensions Basketball court. The course was performed at low speed ({\textless}10.0 km/h), medium speed ({\textgreater}10.0 km/h and {\textless}20.0 km/h) and high speed ({\textgreater}20.0 km/h). Root mean square error (RMSE) and percentage of variance accounted for ({\%}VAF) were used as accuracy measures. The obtained data showed acceptable accuracy results for both RMSE and {\%}VAF, despite the expected degree of error in position measurement at higher speeds. The RMSE for all the distances and velocities presented an average absolute error of 0.30 ± 0.13 cm with 90.61 ± 8.34 of {\%}VAF, in line with most available systems, and considered acceptable for indoor sports. The processing of data with filter correction seemed to reduce the noise and promote a lower relative error, increasing the {\%}VAF for each measured distance. Research using positional-derived variables in Basketball is still very scarce; thus, this independent test of the NBN23{\textregistered} tracking system provides accuracy details and opens up opportunities to develop new performance indicators that help to optimize training adaptations and performance.},

abstract = {This paper aims to identify common sport activity recognition by using inertial sensor. Various classifiers from the Classification Learner App in MATLAB is used to recognize the common sport activity. In data collection, 10 subjects are asked to perform several common sport activities which is stationary, walking, jogging, sprinting, and jumping. The data is collected by using Physilog{\textregistered} 4 Silver which is an inertial sensor from Gait Up that is attached to the chest of the subject using strap. 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data from inertial sensor is observed and processed in this study. To recognize the common sport activity from the data, time-domain features such as mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum value is extracted from the signal produced by inertial sensor. After that, the data is trained using the selected features and 10-fold cross validation is applied to set the training and testing data. The confusion matrix and accuracy result from each classifier is observed. In conclusion, Support Vector Machine with Cubic SVM is selected as the best model in recognizing common sport activity as it produced the highest accuracy, 91.2{\%} in the confusion matrix. This classifier performance outperforms other classifiers in detecting five types of common sport activity from the data collected.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comparative study on the different techniques of classifying human activities that are performed using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. The classification techniques implemented and compared in this study are: Bayesian decision making (BDM), the least-squares method (LSM), the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), dynamic time warping (DTW), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Daily and sports activities are classified using five sensor units worn by eight subjects on the chest, the arms, and the legs. Each sensor unit comprises a triaxial gyroscope, a triaxial accelerometer, and a triaxial magnetometer. Principal component analysis (PCA) and sequential forward feature selection (SFFS) methods are employed for feature reduction. For a small number of features, SFFS demonstrates better performance and should be preferable especially in real-time applications. The classifiers are validated using different cross-validation techniques. Among the different classifiers we have considered, BDM results in the highest correct classification rate with relatively small computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Indoor pedestrian tracking extends location-based services to indoor environments where GPS signal is rarely detected. Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},

abstract = {Motion tracking based on commercial inertial measurements units (IMUs) has been widely studied in the latter years as it is a cost-effective enabling technology for those applications in which motion tracking based on optical technologies is unsuitable. This measurement method has a high impact in human performance assessment and human-robot interaction. IMU motion tracking systems are indeed self-contained and wearable, allowing for long-lasting tracking of the user motion in situated environments. After a survey on IMU-based human tracking, five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion. IMU based estimation was matched against motion tracking based on the Vicon marker-based motion tracking system considered as ground truth. Results show that all but one of the selected models perform similarly (about 35 mm average position estimation error). {\textcopyright}2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {Providing accurate and opportune information on people's activities and behaviors is one of the most important tasks in pervasive computing. Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Wearable inertial systems are a promising technology to address this limitation. This paper presents a new wearable sensing system to record human movements for sports monitoring.

The combined information from this set of sensors allows determining the trajectory and orientation of the robot at any moment to complement the information from its navigation system. Initially, it was necessary to build controlled test environments that allow observing and getting to know the trajectory and the dimensions thereof for capturing the raw data of the mobile robotic platform. Then, the data obtained form the sensor was processed off-line applying a Kalman filter with the aim to remove Gaussian noise; to estimating the trajectory and the absolute orientation of the mobile robotic platform the proposed algorithm was implemented. This implementation used the hardware elements are inexpensive, thus allowing the necessary testing, the data analysis and the interpretation of the outcome to be replicable and to be used as an educational tool within courses of undergraduate and master level. The elements of hardware used in this implementation are cheap, allowing its reproduction for the analysis and interpretation of data and can be used as an educational tool in courses of undergraduate and master level.},

abstract = {Objective: Sport research often requires human motion capture of an athlete. It can, however, be labour-intensive and difficult to select the right system, while manufacturers report on specifications which are determined in set-ups that largely differ from sport research in terms of volume, environment and motion. The aim of this review is to assist researchers in the selection of a suitable motion capture system for their experimental set-up for sport applications. An open online platform is initiated, to support (sport)researchers in the selection of a system and to enable them to contribute and update the overview. Design: systematic review; Method: Electronic searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were performed, and the reference lists of the screened articles were scrutinised to determine human motion capture systems used in academically published studies on sport analysis. Results: An overview of 17 human motion capture systems is provided, reporting the general specifications given by the manufacturer (weight and size of the sensors, maximum capture volume, environmental feasibilities), and calibration specifications as determined in peer-reviewed studies. The accuracy of each system is plotted against the measurement range. Conclusion: The overview and chart can assist researchers in the selection of a suitable measurement system. To increase the robustness of the database and to keep up with technological developments, we encourage researchers to perform an accuracy test prior to their experiment and to add to the chart and the system overview (online, open access).},
